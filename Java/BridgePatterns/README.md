# Bridge Patterns

## GoF Definition: 
Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

## Concept 
In this pattern, the abstract class is separated from the implementation class and we provide a bridge interface between them. This interface helps us to make concrete class functionalities independent from the interface implementer class. We can alter these different kind of classes structurally without affecting each other.
