# Composite Patterns

## GoF Definition: 
Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. The composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

## Concept 
This pattern can show part-whole hierarchy among objects. A client can treat a composite object just like a single object. In object-oriented programming, we make a composite object when we have many objects with common functionalities. This relationship is also termed a “has-a” relationship among objects.

## Intent

- Compose objects into tree structures to represent whole-part hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- Recursive composition
- "Directories contain entries, each of which could be a directory."
- One-to-many "has a" up the "is a" hierarchy
