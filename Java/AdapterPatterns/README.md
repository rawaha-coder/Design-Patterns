# Adapter Patterns

## GoF Definition: 
Convert the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. The adapter pattern lets classes work together that couldn’t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

## Concept 
An Adapter pattern acts as a connector between two incompatible interfaces that otherwise cannot be connected directly. An Adapter wraps an existing class with a new interface so that it becomes compatible with the client’s interface.
