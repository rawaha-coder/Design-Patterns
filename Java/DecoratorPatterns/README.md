# Decorator Patterns

## GoF Definition: 
Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

## Concept 
This main principle of this pattern says that we cannot modify existing functionalities but we can extend them. 
In other words, this pattern is open for extension but closed for modification. 
The core concept applies when we want to add some specific functionalities to some specific object instead of to the whole class.
