# Builder Patterns

## GoF Definition: 
Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction processes can create different representations.

## Concept 
The pattern is useful when a creational algorithm of a complex object is independent of the assembly of the parts of the object. 
The construction process is also capable of building a different representation of that object under consideration.
