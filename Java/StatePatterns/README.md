# State Patterns

## GoF Definition: 
Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

## Concept 
The state pattern is used to encapsulate varying behavior for the same object, based on its internal state. This can be a cleaner way for an object to change its behavior at runtime without resorting to conditional statements and thus improve maintainability
