# Singleton Patterns

## Definition:
Singleton Pattern is a software design pattern, which restricts the instantiation of the class to just only one instance. Also, it provides a global point of access to it. 

## Kotlin code
to create the Kotlin code for Singleton Pattern, you must use Kotlin object declaration as follows: 

> **object Singleton

Yeah!!!. Thatâ€™s it. Only one line of code and you can avoid all lines of code in java or other languages. An object is just a data type with a thread-safe singleton implementation.
